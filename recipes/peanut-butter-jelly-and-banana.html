      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>A peanut butter and jelly sandwich is a classic lunch food, but being
        a classic means its rather mundane. If you like peanut butter and jelly
        but if you want to mix it up, a little banana is the perfect touch!</p>

      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Two slices of bread</li>
        <li>Peanut butter or a suitable alternative</li>
        <li>Jelly of your choose of fruit</li>
        <li>One banana</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Set both slices of bread on a plate</li>
        <li>With a butter knife, spread the jelly on the face-up side of one of
          the slices</li>
        <li>Wipe the jelly off the knife on the face-up side of the second
          slice of bread</li>
        <li>Spread the peanut butter on the face-up side of the second slice of
          bread</li>
        <li>Peel the banana</li>
        <li>Use the knife to cut thin slices of banana and place them on the
          second slice of bread until the surface is covered</li>
        <li>Place the first slice of bread face down on the second slice so the
          peanut butter and jelly are both on the inside and the banana slices
          are in the center</li>
        <li>(Optional) Gently cut the sandwich in half - cut with horizontal
          motions and don't press down</li>
      </ol>
